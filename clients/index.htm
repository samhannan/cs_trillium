								<p>Trillium Associates prides itself on its high quality recruitment process, which ensures that we provide the best candidates for every client's specific requirements. We take time to pre-screen and pre-select candidates before submitting their details to you, ensuring accurate matching from both a client and candidate perspective.</p>

<h2>Permanent recruitment process</h2>

<p>Every candidate is pre-screened by our consultants using the following process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A trained Consultant will assess the overall quality of the candidate, question in depth about their employment history and accurately determine the personal and career motivators of the candidate.</li>
	<li>A CV is produced for each candidate.</li>
	<li>References are requested and provided, where possible from previous employers.</li>
	<li>Every candidate is fully briefed on the role to ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the role, the company, the career progression, support for professional development.</li>
	<li>It is our aim to provide a client with 2-3 quality CV's for each position.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Temporary Workers and Contractors</h2>

<p>The process for the supply of Contract workers is similar to our permanent recruitment process, whereby we ensure total suitability and understanding of the role. We endeavor to obtain a reference from a client when a contractor completes an assignment to ensure that the referencing process is constantly refreshed for each candidate.</p>

<p>We also qualify that the worker is suitably trained in the role, holds the relevant qualifications and tickets as well as their eligibility to work within the UK.</p>

<p>Health and Safety is priority within the Construction Industry especially in the provision of Temporary Workers and Contractors to sites. We have introduced a number of initiatives including verbal site risk assessments with the client prior to commencement of the candidate and ongoing active and practical support of the CSCS initiative. All candidates provided within construction sites hold a valid basic CSCS card. </p>
